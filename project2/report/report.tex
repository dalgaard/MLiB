\section*{Status of project}

\begin{enumerate}
\item We have implemented both the Viterbi algorithm and the
  forward\--backward algorithm with success.
\item In order to avoid underflow problems we use the log transformation for 
	the Viterbi algorithm and we have implemented both scaling  and a log 
	transformation for the forward\--backward algorithm.
\item In addition we have implemented the limited memory approach and
  only saving $\sqrt{N}$ columns in memory for both viterbi and
  forward\--backward and reconstructing blocks as needed.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Validation of program}

We have used the provided test data to
validate our implementation, and all numbers and sequences computed by
our program agree with the provided test output files.
