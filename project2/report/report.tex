\section*{Status of project}

\begin{enumerate}
\item We have implemented both the Viterbi algorithm and the
  forward\--backward algorithm with success.
\item We use log space in the Viterbi algorithm and scaling in the
  forward\--backward algorithm to avoid underflow problems.
\item In addition we have played with the limited memory approach and
  only saving $\sqrt{N}$ columns in memory for both viterbi and
  forward\--backward and reconstructing blocks as needed.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Validation of program}

We have used the provided test data to
validate our implementation, and all numbers and sequences computed by
our program agree with the provided test output files.
